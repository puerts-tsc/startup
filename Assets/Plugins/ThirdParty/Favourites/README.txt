# Unity Favourites Panel

This will add a new panel with a Tree View where you add categories and can drag-and-drop objects from the Hierarchy or Project panel into.

- The panel can be opened from menu: `Window > Favourites`.
- Use the [+] button in the Favourites panel's toolbar to add a new category.
- Use the [-] button to remove the selected category and all its items or to remove a single selected item.
- Double-click on an item to open it. For example to open a scene you have added to Favourites.
- Right-click to ping a Favourites item in the Hierarchy or Project panel.
- Drag-and-drop items to new categories or other areas of Unity. You can for example drag-and-drop a Sprite from the Favourites panel into the property of a component's Inspector (if that property accept Sprites).
